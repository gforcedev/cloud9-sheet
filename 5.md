#5. Testing our Webpage

Click the run button next to preview, and you will see a new tab appear saying "run". Look for the line which says

"Starting Apache httpd, serving **https://________________________" **

Mine will be slightly different to yours. Copy and paste the bit in bold, and paste it into a new tab in your browser.
Voila! You can see your webpage, and your links work properly. If you have a server error, check if there is a dot at the end of the url bar - eg 
"test.html**.**"
