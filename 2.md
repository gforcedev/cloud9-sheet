#2. New Workspace
---

Cloud9 workspaces are actually virtual machines running ubuntu. basicaly, a 
pretend computer. This means you can do some
pretty unique and fancy stuff.

Click the create new workspace button, and give your workspace a name and a

description - 
I'll call mine test. Choose custom for the workspace template, and when you 
hit create
new, then it will load up your brand new workspace. You can then see all of your
files in the tree on the right, and create a new one with the menus at the top.
