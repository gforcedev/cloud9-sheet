#2. New Workspace
Then, from the dashboard, create a new workspace.

Cloud9 workspaces are actually a virtual machine running ubuntu. This basically means
that the people at Cloud9 have made a pretend computer, and that means you can do some
pretty unique and fancy stuff.

Click the create new workspace button, and give your workspace a name and a description - 
I'll call mine test. Choose custom for the workspace template, and when you hit create
new, then it will load up your brand new workspace.
