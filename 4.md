Now, click the Preview button on the top bar (next to run). Select "live preview file", and then you will see your
html file rendered on the right, as it would look in a browser. Now, your can add some things to your previous html file. I'm going to add a link to
project tigr. I will put it between the `</p>` and the `</body>`.


```html
<a href="https://www.project-tigr.co.uk">Go to tigr</a>
```

If you closed your preview tab, open it back up and click on your link. **Nothing happens**.
This is because cloud9 is smart and knows that you probably don't want to go off the page you are on - your workspace.

This is good, as cloud9 can also host your test website for you. Let's do that now.
