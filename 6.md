#6. Beyond...



We have just scratched the surface of what cloud can do. Maybe you want to test your 
website in different browsers without leaving your workspace. Maybe you want to try
a language you've never tried before. Or perhaps you want to use an interpreter for
your language, like the python console. I will show you how to do this.

---

If you cannot see a tab at the bottom of your workspace with the title bash, then
click file-new terminal. Then, type `python` into the terminal. You are now in a 
python console. That was easy! Now type `print("hello world")` and look at the result.

You could also do this with another language. I am going to pick lua to show you.
